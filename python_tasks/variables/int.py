#This is a training lesson on variable assignment.
#Small reminder before you start:
#! 1. Names can not start with a number.
#! 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
#! 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
#! 4. It's considered best practice that names are lowercase.
#! 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
#! 6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"
